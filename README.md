# exploring the payment infra in Pakistan

The goal here is to understand the process from registering a
business to getting a payment gateway for your software product. 

The audience is final year students.

How hard is it for a final year student to get a payment gateway
for his or her software product. 


# current gateways
[Safepay](https://getsafepay.pk/) is kinda bad ngl. 
Their developer docs aren't that great. 
[This](https://safepay-docs.netlify.app/payments/go-live-checklist/) is their go live checklist, it just says "Hello". Their [knowledge base](https://safepay.helpscoutdocs.com/) is not bad but also not good. The redir link are outdated. The thing isn't just coherent.  

What I do get is that there is a whole kyc process from [here](https://safepay.helpscoutdocs.com/article/118-merchant-onboarding-form). More on KYC [here](#kyc)



# kyc

[KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) is important. Safepay tells you what you need for their kyc.
